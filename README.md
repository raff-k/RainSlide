# RainSlide: Rainfall-induced landslide analysis tools

This package provides valuable tools to analyze rainfall-induced
landslides. In RainSlide the following analytic tools are implemented:

- **survey** based on [Bornaetxea et
  al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-2455-2018): Calculation of
  the effective surveyed area. The original Python script was translated
  to R and adapted to fit the raster-requirements. For computation GRASS
  GIS is required.
- **event** based on [Melillo et
  al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-014-0471-3) and
  [2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.024): Objective
  reconstruction of rainfall events responsible for landslides. The
  rainfall threshold is calculated using `RainSlide::thresh`.
- **thresh** based on [Peruccacci et
  al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.10.005) and [Rossi
  et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.02.001):
  Calculation of cumulated event rainfall–duration (ED) thresholds using
  the frequentist method.

The programming code is based on the references, but may vary slightly
due to R-specifications or computational performance reasons.
